The built environment is comprised of many different materials, and for many, detailed knowledge of their fire behavior is limited or non-existent. I as part of the UL Fire Safety Research Institute (FSRI) team that developed the Materials and Products (MaP) Database to address this information gap. The MaP is an interactive, web-based repository populated with data from rigorous testing of the contemporary products and materials commonly found in the modern built environment.
