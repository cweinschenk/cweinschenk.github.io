Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Smokeview (SMV) are open source tools primarily built and maintained by <a href="https://nist.gov" target="_blank">NIST</a>. FDS is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of fire-driven fluid flow. FDS solves numerically, a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed (Ma < 0.3), thermally-driven flow with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires. Smokeview is a separate visualization program that is used to display the results of an FDS simulation.

## Usage Examples
Below are a couple examples where FDS has been used to assist the fire service to better understand fire dynamics following critical incidents.
