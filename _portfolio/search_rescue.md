UL Firefighter Safety Research Institute (FSRI) conducted a series of  full-scale, live-fire experiments as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant-supported “Study of Fire Service Residential Home Size-Up and Search & Rescue Operations” research project. The purpose of the experiments was to improve firefighter effectiveness in order to increase the number of occupants saved during house fires. The experiments are being conducted in two residential structures constructed for use at our Delaware County (DELCO) laboratory facility. Normally, in addition to welcoming technical panel members, the UL FSRI team would host a Visitor’s Day welcoming participants from across the U.S. to witness our research experiments in person. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we could not host visitors. Therefore, we live-streamed an experiment which you can watch below.
