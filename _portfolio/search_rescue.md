UL Fire Safety Research Institute (FSRI) conducted 21 full-scale, live-fire experiments as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant-supported “Study of Fire Service Residential Home Size-Up and Search & Rescue Operations” research project. The purpose of the experiments was to quanitify the tactics of search and rescue to improve firefighter effectiveness and correspondingly occupant tenability during house fires. The experiments were  conducted in two residential structures purpose build for use at our Delaware County (DELCO) laboratory facility. Normally, in addition to welcoming technical panel members, the UL FSRI team would host a Visitor Day to welcome guests from across the U.S. to witness our research experiments in person. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we could not host visitors. Therefore, we live-streamed an experiment which you can watch below.
