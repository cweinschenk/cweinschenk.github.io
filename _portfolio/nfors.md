The National Fire Operations Reporting System (<a href="http://nfors.org/" target="_blank">NFORS</a>) project is funded through an Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program's (AFG), Fire Prevention and Safety Grant (FP&S). The goal of NFORS is to improve firefighter and civilian safety through consistent and quality data. Local fire departments using the NFORS Modules can assess the impact of their response availability, capability, and operational effectiveness on the 'outcome' of a fire or other emergency. An optimal 'outcome' minimizes the occurrence of firefighter injury and death, civilian injury and death, and property loss. The two main modules of NFORS are the CAD module for real-time data analytics and the exposure module for developing a career diary for fire fighter exposures. Below is a snapshot of the CAD Module dashboard:
